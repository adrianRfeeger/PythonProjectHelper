# ✅ Content Inclusion Checkbox - RESTORED

## 🎯 Functionality Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The "Include file contents in export" checkbox has been **restored and enhanced** with smart behavior that adapts to the selected export format.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Analysis-Only Formats
For formats like **Basic JSON** and **Basic Markdown**:
- ✅ **Checkbox is enabled** - user can toggle on/off
- 📄 **When checked**: File contents are included in the export
- 📊 **When unchecked**: Only analysis data is exported (no source code)
- 💾 **File sizes**: ~2.7x larger with content included

### Full-Content Formats  
For formats like **Complete JSON**, **Complete Markdown**, and **Styled HTML**:
- 🔒 **Checkbox is auto-disabled** - always includes content
- ✅ **Always checked**: These formats are designed to include all source code
- 🔄 **Text changes** to "✅ Source code included (full-content format)"

---

## 🖥️ CLI Usage

```bash
# Include content in analysis formats
python cli.py /path/to/project --format basic-json --include-content --output report.json

# Export without content (analysis only)
python cli.py /path/to/project --format basic-json --output report.json

# Full-content formats always include content (flag ignored)
python cli.py /path/to/project --format full-content-json --output backup.json
```

## 🎨 GUI Behavior

1. **Select Analysis Format** (Basic JSON/Markdown, LLM-TDS)
   - Checkbox is **enabled** and controllable
   - Default state respects user's last choice
   - File tree selection still applies when enabled

2. **Select Full-Content Format** (Complete JSON/Markdown, Styled HTML)
   - Checkbox **automatically disables** and checks itself
   - Text changes to indicate content is always included
   - File tree selection still applies for filtering

3. **Smart Descriptions**
   - Each format shows helpful description
   - Clearly indicates whether content is included by default

---

## 📊 Test Results

**CLI Testing:**
- ✅ With `--include-content`: 35/428 files with content (1.1MB)
- ✅ Without flag: 0/428 files with content (400KB)

**GUI Testing:**
- ✅ Analysis formats: Checkbox controllable
- ✅ Full-content formats: Checkbox auto-disabled
- ✅ Smart text updates work correctly

## 🚀 Benefits Restored

1. **User Control**: Choose exactly what to include in analysis exports
2. **File Size Management**: Significantly smaller exports when content not needed
3. **Smart UX**: Interface adapts to format capabilities
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same logic works in both CLI and GUI
5. **Backward Compatible**: Full-content formats work exactly as before

**The checkbox is now fully functional and provides the expected content control! 🎉**
